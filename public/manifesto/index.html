  <p>Replication of scientific experiments is critical to the advance of
science. Computer Science has the enormous advantage that computational
experiments are inherently highly replicable, since computers are
extremely good at doing the same thing over and over again.
Unfortunately, the discipline of Computer Science has never treated
replication seriously. Experiments are not normally replicated, and are
not normally replicable in any meaningful way. There is a recent trend
towards making source code for experiments available, but this only
addresses the openness of methods. It can be close to impossible to make
that code run in the first place, and – in the happy event that is even
possible – use that code to produce data akin to that reported in a
paper. I propose that this must change for the health of the discipline.
I propose that the only credible technique to make experiments truly
replicable is to provide copies of virtual machines in which the
experiments are validated to run on the day the experiment was done. I
propose that tools and repositories should be made available to make
this happen. I wish to be one of those who makes it happen.</p>

<p>Before the manifesto itself, a word about the name: “recomputation&#8221;. The
natural word ‘replication’ would cause confusion given its
well-established technical meaning in computing. I have chosen the word
‘recomputation’ to mean the replication of computational experiments.
This is adding a specific meaning to an existing word,[<sup>1]</sup> but the new
meaning adds only a nuance and also serves usefully to distinguish
replication of computational experiments from other types of experiment.</p>

<h1>1. Computational experiments should be recomputable for all time.</h1>

<p>Why recomputable? And why for all time?</p>

<p>The necessity for recomputation is simple. An experiment is used to form
scientific conclusions, and those conclusions are never final. They may
always be subject to question, so experimental work may need to be
repeated. I would even argue that the less experiments are replicated,
the <em>more</em> important it is that they be recomputable. The reason is that
flaws in an experiment that is frequently replicated are likely to come
to light, but not so if the experiment is rarely replicated. The more
rarely an experiment is repeated, the longer the time lapse until it is,
and the less likely a new researcher will be able to replicate it easily
without the original experiment being deliberately made recomputable. If
the original experiment is flawed in some way, misleading results can
lie uncorrected in the literature for years Beck, Prosser, and Wallace
(2004).</p>

<p>Should experiments be recomputable for all time? Yes. Computer Science
is unique in having this ability. Imagine if physicists had the
opportunity to look through Galileo’s telescopes at Jupiter’s moons, but
couldn’t be bothered to store them. There is no reasonable limit to what
is the useful life of an experiment is, so the simplest answer is to
have no limit. Moore’s law, while it lasts, makes it technically
feasible to store experiments forever. It’s affordable, because of
storage costs. Amazon Glacier now costs 12 per year per GB. With
decreasing storage costs, it’s reasonable to guess that \$1 per GB would
be enough to pay for permanent storage. It’s even affordable to rerun
all computational experiments in history regularly. If researchers
donated 10% of CPU resources for new experiments to recomputing old
ones, all 5 year old experiments could be rerun each year.[<sup>2]</sup></p>

<h1>2. Recomputation of recomputable experiments should be very easy</h1>

<p>Recomputation should be very easy. Ideally, very easy means clicking a
button. This will not always be possible, but we should make it as easy
as we possibly can for experimenters to reproduce their own experiments
and those of other researchers.</p>

<p>An important point about this manifesto is that by recomputation I focus
mainly on the exact replication of an experiment. No other choice is
available since (as I argue below) we have to duplicate the exact
experimental conditions to ensure that recomputation is possible.
Drummond argues powerfully that this - which he calls ‘replicability’ -
is the poor cousin of ‘reproducibility’, where experiments are
reproduced with changes to factors believed to be insignificant Drummond
(2009). There is no question that key advances in science should be
reproducible in Drummond’s richer sense, but neither do I accept that
“the impoverished version, replicability, is one not worth having&#8221;. To
take a non-computational example, it would be wonderful if the original
experiments on cold fusion could be replicated exactly. If there was
some technical flaw with the experiments, it could be discovered, or if
not the effects that led to the apparent conclusion that cold fusion
existed could be investigated. Once we have ensured that experiments can
be recomputed exactly, we can have the luxury of seeking to ensure that
experiments can be reproduced in richer ways.</p>

<h1>3. It should be easier to make experiments recomputable than not to</h1>

<p>How can it be easier to make new experiments recomputable than not to
bother? I draw your attention to Jon Claerbout’s words Claerbout:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“It’s not really for the benefit of other people. Experience shows
the principal beneficiary of reproducible research is you the author
yourself.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve been doing major computational experiments for 20 years: some of
them I am rather proud of. But whenever I start on a new set of
experiments, my heart sinks a little. I expect the pain of getting
everything set up, and then I expect the difficulty or impossibility of
reproducing my experiments if, say, the paper is rejected and I need to
rerun them for a later submission. We should fix this. Tools should be
available to make it easier to run experiments, encourage good
experimental practice, and simultaneously make them recomputable. An
experienced experimenter’s heart should sink no more than an experienced
programmer when starting a new program.</p>

<h1>4. Tools and repositories can help recomputation become standard</h1>

<p>I draw an analogy with git or other source code control tools. Learning
and using git adds complication to one’s life. But the benefits are
enormous, and without question it is easier overall to build and
maintain code using source code control systems than without. Once we
have the appropriate tools and repositories we in Computer Science will
have an enormous advantage over other sciences. Many sciences have
massive online repositories, of course leveraging advances in Computer
Science to their benefit. We can be unique in having massive online
repositories of fully realised experiments, not just the data resulting
from experiments. We should research and make available tools and
repositories for the recomputation of scientific experiments. Sadly,
tools for recomputation are relatively lacking to date, although there
are promising signs. For example, in a single PhD thesis, Philip Guo
introduced Burrito, a tool for electronic lab notebooks, and CDE, an
automatic packaging tool for experiments in linux Guo (2012).</p>

<h1>5. The <em>only</em> way to ensure recomputability is to provide virtual machines</h1>

<p>While the other points of the manifesto state how I think the world
should be, this point is an empirical statement about how the world is.
There are two reasons that virtual machines are - at least for now - the
only way to go. The first is the almost universal (I suspect) experience
among anyone who has built software and especially tried to rebuild it
later. A build of the resulting program (and hence experiment) can fail
due to arbitrary changes in the machine being used. This applies even
where the machine is physically the same one that was used months ago to
run an experiment the first time. An innocent software update, to a
package not obviously used by the build software, can cause disaster. If
the machine is not the same one or a clone thereof, all bets are off.
The <em>only</em> way to ensure an experiment is recomputable is to make
available a virtual machine identical to one which was tested and worked
when the experiment was originally run.</p>

<p>The second reason is that the available computers and operating systems
change over time. It may be true that code you make available today can
be built with only minor pain by many people on current computers. That
is unlikely to be true in 5 years, and hardly credible in 20.</p>

<p>A classic example illustrates both these reasons. SHRDLU is one of the
most famous programs in the history of AI. The complete source code is
available, but it cannot be run. Although the physical machine and OS it
ran on can be emulated, we do not have the exact machine state that
enabled the program to run. Amongst other issues, Terry Winograd changed
his own copy of Lisp, changes that are now lost.[<sup>3]</sup> What we need – and
should provide for new experiments – is an exact virtual machine in
which the experiment worked. There are isolated cases out there of
researchers providing virtual machines for recomputation, such as Brown
Brown (2012; Brown et al. 2012). We need to take this from an isolated
case of a keen researcher pushing the envelope, and turn it into the
standard way Computer Scientists do business. Howe makes the case more
eloquently than I can, giving 13 reasons why virtual machines in the
cloud can improve reproducibility B. Howe (2012).</p>

<h1> 6. Runtime performance is a secondary issue</h1>

<p>This manifesto is about allowing recomputation of experiments. If a
measure is deterministic, e.g. the result of a fixed computation, or the
number of nodes in a non-random search tree, it should be replicated
every time the experiment is recomputed. But we cannot guarantee the
same results in terms of non-deterministic measures such as cpu time. By
using virtual machines, we may obtain different results as are seen on a
physical machine, and future results on virtual machines may differ from
current ones. Even where serious efforts are made, no guarantee that
run-time results are replicable can be obtained. For example, even
though max-clique researchers have a standard methodology for
cross-referencing cpu times, Prosser has shown that these results cannot
be relied on even approximately Prosser (2012).</p>

<p>I conclude that we must tackle the easier problems first. Ensuring
recomputation of experiments is not easy, but it is critical and at
least achievable. Obtaining meaningfully replicable cpu time comparisons
requires significant additional research – if it is even possible. But,
by allowing recomputation of experiments, we allow researchers to
recompute experiments in a variety of environments, discovering if
conclusions about run times are universal or contingent on a particular
environment. The critical thing is to preserve scientific experiments.
It’s unarguable that if we can’t recompute an experiment at all, we
can’t preserve run time performance.</p>

<h1>The recomputation.org Manifesto</h1>

<p>I am starting <a href="http://recomputation.org">http://recomputation.org</a> as repository for replicable
experiments, and starting to work on the tools to use on the site. Based
on my arguments above I have the following plans. The overriding goal is
the following mission statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>*If we can compute your experiment now, anyone can recompute it 20
years from now *</p></blockquote>

<p>The site &lt;recomputation.org> is brand new and (as I write) holds zero
experiments. But the following are the principles which we will use in
developing it to deliver the mission statement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will make available virtual machines or
equivalent technology to allow exact recomputation of lodged
experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will make its best efforts to ensure that all
experiments which it believes to be recomputable will remain
recomputable for all time.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will always be free to those lodging bona-fide
scientific experiments and to those obtaining past experiments, at
least where all aspects of the experiments are open source and fees
are not charged for the related scientific publication.[<sup>4]</sup></p></li>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will provide its code and tools using an
appropriate open source licence, including server-side code.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will serve as a testbed for scientific research
into issues such as experimental techniques and methodologies.</p></li>
<li><p>&lt;recomputation.org> will seek to fund its mission through research
funding, donations, and charging for services such as lodging
non-open source or non-freely available experiments.</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Vote Recomputation</h1>

<p>The recomputation manifesto is similar in spirit to the ‘Science Code
Manifesto’,[<sup>5]</sup> but addresses an orthogonal issue. The Science Code
Manifesto demands that code used in scientific publications should be
made available in an open way for the useful lifetime of the
publication. But this is neither a necessary condition for recomputation
nor sufficient for it. Closed source experiments can be recomputed if
the appropriate environment is provided – e.g. a suitable virtual
machine containing the necessary binaries but not source. Arguably
recomputability is <em>more</em> important for closed source than for open
source. But it must not be thought that open source is sufficient for
recomputability. The <em>only</em> guarantee of recomputability is the exact
environment being available. I do endorse the Science Code Manifesto,
and initial efforts at <a href="http://recomputation.org">http://recomputation.org</a> will be focussed on
open source efforts only. As well as the scientific desirability of open
source, it avoids one form of potential licencing problems in
recomputation.</p>

<p>A manifesto is a call that people reading it should vote for your point
of view. Don’t vote with a signature or a petition, or even with your
feet. Vote by making your computational experiments recomputable. Do it
at <a href="http://recomputation.org">http://recomputation.org</a>, or at your own web site, or at another
repository. But make your experiments recomputable.</p>
