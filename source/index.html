<p>
Welcome to recomputation.org.
It is a repository for experiments in computational science. 
</p>

<p>We are looking forward to the <a href="http://www.ecai2014.org/tutorials/#T11">ECAI 2014 tutorial on recomputation </a>, taking place on August 19, 2014.  We will soon be uploading new machines contributed by authors of papers from that conference.



<p>Last year we gave a tutorial 
<a href="http://cp2013.a4cp.org/program/tutorials">tutorial on recomputation</a>
at the Constraint Programming
conference <a href="http://cp2013.a4cp.org/">CP 2013</a>.  
<p>We now have 7 recomputable experiments from papers presented at CP 2013.  <a href="cp2013/index.html">Find them here.</a>

<p>
The 
<a href="blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/">Recomputation Manifesto </a> describes the motivations behind the site.
</p>


<p>
We have now released our <a href="cp2013/experiment1.html">first experiment</a>.  We hope to grow the number of experiments soon.
</p>
