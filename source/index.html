<p>
Welcome to recomputation.org.
It is a repository for experiments in computational science. 
</p>

<p>
The 
<a href="blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/">Recomputation Manifesto </a> describes the motivations behind the site.
</p>


<p>
Currently the number of experiments in our repository is ... zero.   But we hope to change that soon.
