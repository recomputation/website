<p>
Welcome to recomputation.org.
It is a repository for experiments in computational science. 
</p>

<p>Welcome to authors of accepted papers from the Constraint Programming conference <a href=http://cp2013.a4cp.org/">CP 2013</a>.  We are 
delighted to be giving <a href="http://cp2013.a4cp.org/program/tutorials">tutorial on recomputation</a> there. 
A bit more on our plans for CP 2013 is in a <a href="blog/2013/06/10/welcome-to-cp-2013-authors/">recent blog post</a>. We especially thank Christian Schulte and Laurent Michel for their help. 

<p>
The 
<a href="blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/">Recomputation Manifesto </a> describes the motivations behind the site.
</p>


<p>
Currently the number of experiments in our repository is ... zero.   But we hope to change that soon.
</p>
