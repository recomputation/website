<p>
Welcome to recomputation.org.
It is a repository for experiments in computational science. 
</p>

<p>We are very happy to announce that we now have 7 recomputable experiments from papers presented at CP 2013.  <a href="cp2013/index.html">Find them here.</a>

<p>Welcome to authors of accepted papers from the Constraint Programming conference <a href=http://cp2013.a4cp.org/">CP 2013</a>.  We are 
delighted to be giving <a href="http://cp2013.a4cp.org/program/tutorials">tutorial on recomputation</a> there. 
A bit more on our plans for CP 2013 is in a <a href="blog/2013/06/10/welcome-to-cp-2013-authors/">recent blog post</a>. We especially thank Christian Schulte and Laurent Michel for their help. 

<p>
The 
<a href="blog/2013/04/12/the-recomputation-manifesto/">Recomputation Manifesto </a> describes the motivations behind the site.
</p>


<p>
We have now released our <a href="cp2013/experiment1.html">first experiment</a>.  We hope to grow the number of experiments soon.
</p>
