## Recomputation @ CP2013 ##

At the [The 19th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](http://cp2013.a4cp.org/), we asked the authors of accepted papers whether they would be interested in working with us in making their experiments recomputable. This was the first time we had done so.

Slides from the tutorial at CP by Ian Gent and Lars Kotthoff are [available](/papers/CP2013TutorialSlides.pdf).


In total, we received 11 expressions of interest. By the time of the conference,
we had made the 6 experiments listed below recomputable.

* [Bin Packing with Linear Usage Costs - An Application to Energy Management in Data Centres](CMSS.html) by Hadrien Cambazard, Deepak Mehta, Barry O'Sullivan, Helmut Simonis
* [A Scalable Approximate Model Counter](CMV.html) by Supratik Chakraborty, Kuldeep S. Meel, Moshe Y. Vardi
