Ian Gent founded recomputation.org in February 2013.

Website set up with help from John McDermott and Chris Jefferson. Hosting provided by University of St Andrews.

Many scientists have helped with discussions leading to the foundation of the site. 

I would particularly single out Patrick Prosser for tenacious dedication to replicating past experiments and making his own replicable. 

Amongst many others I would also thank fellow authors of "How Not To Do It", namely Stuart Grant, Ewan MacIntyre, Patrick Prosser, Paul Shaw, Barbara Smith, and Toby Walsh. 

For more recent advice and discussions I thank my Adam Barker, Edwin Brady, Chris Jefferson, Lars Kotthoff, Steve Linton, Ian Miguel, Pete Nightingale, Patrick Prosser, and Karen Petrie.
