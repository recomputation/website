Our goal is to make computational science experiments replicable by providing tools and a repository to store experiments in.  To achieve this our mission is:

***If we can compute your experiment now, anyone can recompute it 20 years from now***

##Guiding Principles

[recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org) is brand new and (as I write) holds zero experiments.   But the following are guiding principles which we will use in developing our tools and repository to achieve the mission.


1. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org)  will make available virtual machines or equivalent technology to allow exact recomputation of lodged experiments.

2. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org)  will make its best efforts to ensure that all experiments which it believes to be recomputable will remain recomputable for all time. 

4. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org)  will provide its code and tools using an appropriate open source licence, including server-side code.

3. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org)  will always be free to those lodging bona-fide scientific experiments and to those obtaining past experiments, [provided that](#notes)

    * all aspects of the experiments are freely available, 
    * experimenter's contributions are open source,  and
    * fees are not charged for the related scientific publication.


5. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org) 
will serve as a testbed for scientific research into issues such as experimental techniques and methodologies.

6. [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org) 
will seek to fund its mission through research funding, donations, and charging for services such as lodging non-open source or non-freely available experiments.

* I've written a [long blog post](/blog/2013/02/16/caveats-on-being-free/) on the caveats that come with the intended free price.
