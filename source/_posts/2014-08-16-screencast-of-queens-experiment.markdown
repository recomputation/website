Last night I published a screencast of me recomputing the [queens experiment](/blog/2013/07/01/our-first-experiment-a-chess-puzzle/) from [recomputation.org].

Please do watch it if you'd like to see how easy it is to recompute experiments.

Here's a link [direct to youtube](http://youtu.be/vlV1whY9VJc) if you'd rather watch it there than embedded here.

The two tools that you need mentioned in the video are [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
