On the day after Valentine's Day, 2013, I'd *love* to welcome you to [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org)
My name is [Ian Gent](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ipg) and I'm Professor of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews.

Let me first talk about the name.  "Recomputation" is intended to mean the replication of computational scientific experiments.   It's not a new word - it actually goes back to 1766! - so I am trying to overload it with a new meaning.  But the word "replication" already has a technical computing meaning, so that is not the best name for the job of replication of computing experiments.
