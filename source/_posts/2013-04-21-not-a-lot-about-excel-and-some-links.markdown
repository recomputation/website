Reproducibility of computational experiments hit the headlines the other day.   Instead of citing one of the many news posts about it[(e.g. this one) http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22223190], let's go straight to the source:

[Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff](http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP322.pdf), by Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, Robert Pollin, 15 April, 2013.   

It's quite pleasing that this came out the same day as [The Recomputation Manifesto](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3674): that is the submission date to arXiv was Friday 12th but I think they circulated it on Monday 15th.   Also lucky in a sense as it saved me adding to it as a poster-boy example.   

It's also particularly pleasing that this error was uncovered because students were set an exercise to replicate that study.   What a wonderful thing, and I wish it was far more common in computational science.  

Apart from these short comments there are a couple of reasons I don't want to say much about this.  

First is that [Victoria Stodden](http://blog.stodden.net/2013/04/19/what-the-reinhart-rogoff-debacle-really-shows-verifying-empirical-results-needs-to-be-routine/) has blogged excellently on the implications.   Second is that, since this is an Excel problem, at the minute this is not something we could accept into [recomputation.org](http://recomputation.org), at least accept and provide a full virtual machine.   Which is a pity, but the licencing issues are important. 

While I'm here I want to mention a couple of new links I have added to the [resources page](/resources), which I did not know about (but should have) and found from Victoria's blog post.

* [Setting the Default to Reproducible](http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf), Feb 2013, Report on the
ICERM Workshop on [Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics](http://icerm.brown.edu/tw12-5-rcem), December 2012.  Very useful report with an Appendix full of advice and tool descriptions.

* [Reprozip](https://www.usenix.org/conference/tapp13/reprozip-using-provenance-support-computational-reproducibilitythe). A tool similar to CDE but focussed specifically on allowing reproduction of comptutational experiments.
